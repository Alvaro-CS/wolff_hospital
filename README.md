Created by Susana del Riego, √Ålvaro Cascajero and Alejandra Aceves

This project works together with wolff_patient and wolff_doctor (clients). Read their manual for more info.

**WOLFFGRAM HOSPITAL/ADMIN APP USAGE**

This readme document explains the **server app** , called wolff\_hospital. In order to run our application, the user must start running the server (in the MAIN).


A screen will pop up and a password must be introduced (password=server by default), if this password is correct, the server will open and we will be able to connect to it with the patient or doctor application; otherwise, the server will not open, a message will inform the user that the passwords do not match, and we will not be able either to run the client.


Once the password written is correct, a new window will pop up with two different options. Once button for opening the server, if all goes smoothly a message will show that the server has opened correctly. If the user tries to open the server again but it is already opened, another message in the same window will indicate to the user that the server is already opened.

If the user wants to close the server, he just must click on the Close Server button and a message to the user will indicate that the server was closed correctly.


In the case that the user forgets to close the server, before pressing the X close button of the window, the server will be automatically closed.

Also, if the user wants to close the server and then open again the server, it will be also possible.

With the Server being open, we can run the clients app. We will start explaining the patient app, **wolff\_patient**.
